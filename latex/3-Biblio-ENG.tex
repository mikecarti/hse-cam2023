\chapter{Literature Review}

{\color{red} In this section, we compile references and literature review on the thesis topic. The text is just a machine translation of annotations - it needs to be fully creatively rethought. }

In the article \cite{Tinos2015}, the dynamic TSP with variable weights is explored. The impact of these changes on the problem's fitness landscapes is examined.

The paper addresses key questions about the dynamic TSP, such as "how many solutions are affected by a change?" and "how does the severity of the problem influence the optimal solutions?"

The study includes simulations of the dynamic TSP with weight changes, revealing that the new optimal solutions are usually close to the previous ones.

In \cite{10.1007/11903697_31}, a robust algorithm for solving DTSP is introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm is highly effective, producing high-quality solutions in very short time steps.

\section{Description of Relevant Ideas}

\subsection{Temporal Graphs}

$\bullet$ Each edge $e = (u, v, t) \in E$ is a temporal edge from a vertex $u$ to another vertex $v$ at time $t$. For any two temporal ages $(u,v,t_1)$ and $(u,v,t_2)$ $t_1 \neq t_2$.

$\bullet$ Each vertex $v \in V$ is active when there is a temporal edge that starts or ends at $v$.

$\bullet$ $d(u, v)$: the number of temporal edges from $u$ to $v$ in $G$.

$\bullet$ $E(u, v)$: the set of temporal edges from $u$ to $v$ in $G$, i.e., $E(u,v)=\{(u,v,t_1),(u,v,t_2), ..., (u,v,t_{d(u,v)})\}$.

$\bullet$ $N_{out}(v)$ or $N_{in}(v)$: the set of out-neighbors or in-neighbors of $v$ in $G$, i.e., $N_{out}(v) = \{u : (v, u, t) ∈ E\}$ and $N_{in}(v) = \{u : (u, v, t) ∈ E\}$.

$\bullet$ $d_{out}(v)$ or $d_{in}(v)$: the temporal out-degree or in-degree of $v$ in $G$, defined as $d_{out}(v) = \sum_{u \in N_{out(v}} d(v,u)$ and $d_{in}(v) = \sum_{u \in N_{in(v}} d(u,v)$.

\subsection{Subtypes of TSP}
Based on the book "The Traveling Salesman Problem and Its Variations," two variations of TSP stand out as most relevant to our problem:

{\color{blue}
Moving Target TSP: A set $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ of $n$ objects placed at points $\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}$. Each object $x_i$ is moving from $p_i \in \mathbb{R}^2$ at velocity $v_i$. A pursuer starting at the origin moving with speed $v$ wants to intercept all points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ in the fastest possible time. This problem is related to the time-dependent TSP.

Time-Dependent TSP: For each arc $(i, j)$ of $G$, $n$ different costs $c_{ij}^t = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ are given. The cost $c_{ij}^t$ corresponds to the 'cost' of going from city $i$ to city $j$ in time period $t$. The objective is to find a tour $(\tau(1), \tau(2), \ldots, \tau(n), \tau(1))$, where $\tau(1) = 1$ corresponds to the home location which is in time period zero, in $G$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{\tau(i) \tau(i+1)}^{t_i}$ is minimized. The index $n + 1$ is equivalent to 1. For all $(i, j)$, if $c_{ij}^t = c_{ji}^t = \ldots = c_{ij}^{t'}$, then the time-dependent TSP reduces to the traveling salesman problem.
}

In our case, it seems that the problem encompasses both subtypes.

\subsection{Deep Reinforcement Learning}
In 2023, an article \cite{RL} was published that formulates a problem similar to the one considered in this work. It turned out that our problem is more related to Time-Dependent TSP (TDTSP) rather than Dynamic TSP (DTSP), as initially assumed. 
The authors used a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to solve this problem, introducing an additional complication: new vertices can disappear and appear in the process, which may also be relevant for a football field. Provided the data issue (ensuring a sufficient volume of data for training an RL model with an attention mechanism) is resolved, the authors' methodology can be adapted to our case.

\subsection{Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)}

Problem Statement of VRP:
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an optimization problem aimed at finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles, taking into account several factors such as time, cost, and load capacity. Formally, in VRP, there is a given number of vehicles, each with constraints on load capacity and working hours. There is also a set of client points that need to be visited, and for each point, the load and service time requirements are known. The objective of VRP is to optimally allocate the client points among the vehicles to minimize the total costs, considering all constraints.

Difference from TSP:
The main difference between TSP and VRP is that in TSP, there is one salesman who must visit a set of cities and return to the starting point, minimizing the total distance. In VRP, there are multiple vehicles, each needing to service a set of client points with specific constraints. Therefore, in VRP, it is necessary to optimize the allocation of client points among the vehicles considering various factors such as load capacity, service time, and throughput, making this problem more complex compared to TSP. The VRP problem statement may be relevant in the case of multiple observing cameras.

\subsection{CGN (Convolutional Graph Networks) for TSP}
The article \cite{gnn} discusses the use of GNN for optimizing the route when multiple cities need to be visited and returned to the starting point. The basics of the problem, the application of GNN to it, and the implementation details of the model using Graph Transformer and Residual Gated GCN are discussed. It concludes that the model demonstrates the ability to find optimal routes but requires labeled data, and a promising direction for development could be a transition to reinforcement learning. Labeled data are obtained using the Concorde TSP Solver, meaning that optimal paths for graphs need to be calculated first, and then the neural network training can begin.
