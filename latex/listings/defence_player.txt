1. Create a class called DefencePlayer that inherits from the Player class.
2. Initialize the DefencePlayer with the following parameters:
   - team_name (string): The name of the player's team.
   - team (object): The team object to which the player belongs.
   - player_id (integer): The unique identifier for the player.
   - position (string): The player's current position on the field.
   - grid (object): The grid representing the field.
   - ball (object): The ball object.
   - zone (array): The defensive zone assigned to the player.
   - default_pos (array): The player's default position.
3. In the move method:
   a. Check if the ball is in the player's assigned zone:
      - If yes:
        - If the team mode is 'defensive':
          - If the player is the closest to the ball, set the target position to the ball's current position.
          - Otherwise, set the target position to the midpoint between the closest opposing player and the ball.
        - Otherwise, set the target position to the ball's current position.
      - If no:
        - If the team mode is 'neutral':
          - If the player is the closest to the ball, set the target position to the ball's current position.
          - Otherwise, set the target position to the player's default position.
        - If the team mode is 'defensive', set the target position to the midpoint between the closest opposing player and the ball.
        - Otherwise, set the target position to the player's default position.
   b. Call the move method from the parent class (Player) with the calculated target position.
