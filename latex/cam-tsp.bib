abstract="The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the classic NP hard optimization problems. The Dynamic TSP (DTSP) is arguably even more difficult than general static TSP. Moreover the DTSP is widely applicable to real-world applications, arguably even more than its static equivalent. However its investigation is only in the preliminary stages. There are many open questions to be investigated. This paper proposes an effective algorithm to solve DTSP. Experiments showed that this algorithm is effective, as it can find very high quality solutions using only a very short time step.",

Since there is currently no algorithm with good performance that can perfectly solve this problem, for the solution of the traveling salesman problem, this article first establishes a mathematical model of the traveling salesman problem, and uses four solving methods for the same case: the greedy method, Branch and bound method, dynamic programming method and genetic algorithm, analyze the applicability and accuracy of different algorithms in the same case.}

    abstract = {The increasing complexity of today’s software requires the contribution of thousands of developers. This complex collaboration structure makes developers more likely to introduce defect-prone changes that lead to software faults. Determining when these defect-prone changes are introduced has proven challenging, and using traditional machine learning (ML) methods to make these determinations seems to have reached a plateau. In this work, we build contribution graphs consisting of developers and source files to capture the nuanced complexity of changes required to build software. By leveraging these contribution graphs, our research shows the potential of using graph-based ML to improve Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. We hypothesize that features extracted from the contribution graphs may be better predictors of defect-prone changes than intrinsic features derived from software characteristics. We corroborate our hypothesis using graph-based ML for classifying edges that represent defect-prone changes. This new framing of the JIT defect prediction problem leads to remarkably better results. We test our approach on 14 open-source projects and show that our best model can predict whether or not a code change will lead to a defect with an F1 score as high as 77.55% and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as high as 53.16%. This represents a 152% higher F1 score and a 3% higher MCC over the state-of-the-art JIT defect prediction. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can be used for operational JIT defect prediction.},

abstract={A traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-complete problem. Traditional TSP presumes that the locations of customers and the traveling time among customers are fixed and constant. In real-life cases, however, the traffic conditions and customer requests may change over time. To find the most economic route, the decisions can be made constantly upon the time-point when the salesman completes his service of each customer. This brings in a dynamic version of the traveling salesman problem (DTSP), which takes into account the information of real-time traffic and customer requests. DTSP can be extended to a dynamic pickup and delivery problem (DPDP). In this article, we ameliorate the attention model to make it possible to perceive environmental changes. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve DTSP and DPDP instances with a size of up to 40 customers in 100 locations. Experiments show that our method can capture the dynamic changes and produce a highly satisfactory solution within a very short time. Compared with other baseline approaches, more than 5% improvements can be observed in many cases.},

For these problems, we introduce several integer programming formulations of varying size and strength. Computational experiments conducted on instances of 1|sij|∑Cj (i.e. minimizing total flow time on a single machine under sequence dependent setup times) and 1|sij|∑Tj (i.e. minimizing total tardiness on a single machine under sequence dependent setup times) illustrate the benefits of using stronger formulations, even though the computation of their LP relaxation is more time consuming. Incorporating these improved LP relaxation bounds, we propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm able to solve instances of 1|sij|∑Cj and 1|sij|∑Tj having up to 50 and 45 jobs respectively.}

 abstract = {Given a graph whose arc traversal times vary over time, the time-dependent travelling salesman problem (TDTSP) consists in finding a Hamiltonian tour of least total duration covering the vertices of the graph. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we describe a lower and upper bounding procedure that requires the solution of a simpler (yet NP-hard) asymmetric travelling salesman problem (ATSP). In addition, we prove that this ATSP solution is optimal for the TDTSP if all the arcs share a common congestion pattern. Second, we formulate the TDTSP as an integer linear programming model for which valid inequalities are devised. These inequalities are then embedded into a branch-and-cut algorithm that is able to solve instances with up to 40 vertices.},

abstract = {Congestion in large cities and populated areas is one of the major challenges in urban logistics, and should be addressed at different planning and operational levels. The Time Dependent Travelling Salesman Problem (TDTSP) is a generalization of the well known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the travel times are not assumed to be constant along the day. The motivation to consider the time dependency factor is that it enables to have better approximations to many problems arising from practice. In this paper, we consider the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TDTSP-TW), where the time dependence is captured by considering variable average travel speeds. We propose an Integer Linear Programming model for the problem and develop an exact algorithm, which is compared on benchmark instances with another approach from the related literature. The results show that the approach is able to solve instances with up to 40 customers.}

We used Voronoi diagrams to identify and investigate the spatial dynamics of players’ behavior in Futsal. Using this tool, we examined 19 plays of a sub-phase of a Futsal game played in a reduced area (20m2) from which we extracted the trajectories of all players. Results obtained from a comparative analysis of player’s Voronoi area (dominant region) and nearest teammate distance revealed different patterns of interaction between attackers and defenders, both at the level of individual players and teams. We found that, compared to defenders, larger dominant regions were associated with attackers. Furthermore, these regions were more variable in size among players from the same team but, at the player level, the attackers’ dominant regions were more regular than those associated with each of the defenders. These findings support a formal description of the dynamic spatial interaction of the players, at least during the particular sub-phase of Futsal investigated. The adopted approach may be extended to other team behaviors where the actions taken at any instant in time by each of the involved agents are associated with the space they occupy at that particular time.}
