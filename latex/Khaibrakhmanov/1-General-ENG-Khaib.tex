\chapter{Description of the problem setting for the course work}


\section{General Work Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Delve into the research topic and get familiar with the associated literature.
    \item Solve the TSP problem for navigating players statically positioned on the field.
    \item Develop a simulation for debugging and testing the long-focus camera control algorithm.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Process pre-annotated data to build a heat map of player movement.
        \item Based on heat maps, implement a model of player movement on the field, closely matching their real-game movements.
        \item Develop a metric to fairly evaluate the simulation performance.
        \item Integrate agent behavior simulation to camera simulation.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate the results and discuss them, derive conclusions.
\end{enumerate}

The general pipeline of the whole project (in association with Timchenko Daniil) is presented on the Figure~\ref{fig:gen-pipe}. Personally, I was assigned to develop the solution to the TSP problem for navigating players statically positioned on the field, as well as the implementation of a model of player movement part. 

\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Static TSP}
Given a football field on which there are players and a ball, the task is to provide an ordered list of player id's (player numbers) for a particular timestamp, which is a frame in our case.

\subsection{Simulation}
Given two datasets: one for the 'Home' team and another for the 'Away' team — each containing information about the positions of the players and the ball the task is to create a model that closely resembles real-world soccer game data for both teams. To evaluate the simulation, we’ll use the following metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Average mean speed of a player
    \item Average variance of speed of a player
    \item Mean average directional vector
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approximations and limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If one has the intentions to have many more amenities than football players, as well as a distinct quantity of facilities, then another algorithmic approach should be considered.
    \item The camera should be brought back to the center of the field, as it starts there.
\end{itemize}
